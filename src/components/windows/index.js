   * OIDC Consent is a very special case, because it is only available as

   * it everywhere.
   * Maybe some React.lazy to lazyload things would be good, but OIDC requests
   * shouldn't be slow.
   * It's also not in AVAILABLE_POPUPS, but rather gets served sepeartely by
   * the /oidc route and it can not work without window.ssv.params.
   *
   * Maybe every single window should be lazy loaded and we additional set the
   * current script in popupHtml?
