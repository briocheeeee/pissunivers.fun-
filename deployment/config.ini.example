# ================================ E-Mail =====================================#

# pixelplanet can use the sendmail command to send verification and password
# forgotten emails.

# to gmail, or wherever. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSMTP

# set to yes to enable sending mails

MAIL_ADDRESS = donotreply@example.com

# ================================ Paths ======================================#

# to run pixelplanet within a path, like http://example.com/ppfun/, set this to
# e.g. /ppfun
# Shall NOT end with "/", but shall start with "/"

#BASENAME = /ppfun

# to run APIs under a different URL, set API_URLs here. This can be multiple
# comma seperated URLs, in which case the game will load balance between them
# Shall NOT end with "/"

#API_URLs = https://sca.pixelplanet.fun, https://scb.pixelplanet.fun

# to serve assets (and only assets) via a CDN, this CDN_URL can be set,
# pixelplanet will not allow access APIs on that URL, to protect the users
# from cloudflares MitM attack.
# If you want to run the whole game behind a CDN, you should not set this,
# this option is only useful if you want to serve the bandwidth intensive
# requests on a CDN, and nothing else
# Shall NOT end with "/"

#CDN_URL = https://cdn.pixelplanet.fun

# Two letter country codes for countries that can access the game without CDN,
# this is useful in case of blocks against a CDN.
# The country needs to have a translation available, associated to its country
# code.
# It will be checked on the client if the CDN is available and the CDN will be
# used if it is.

#NO_CDN_COUNTRIES = cn,gr

# Requests on this host will not load balance API_URLs, this is only useful
# if you run a seperate second domain that you don't want to share connections
# with the other.
# This option is ignored at best, barely useful
# Shall not include protocol (e.g. "http://")

#UNSHARDED_HOST = fuckyouarkeros.fun

# Hosts that we allow API access from. If you are using multiple domains, this
# should be set to all of them. Allows all subdomains by default.
# Accepts multiple hosts comma seperated
# Shall start with a '.'
# Shall not include protocol (e.g. "http://")

#CORS_HOSTS = localhost:5000

# ============================= OpenID Connect ================================#

# Pixelplanet can act as OpenID provider, so other websites can implement a
# third party oauth login against it, for this we have to know the URL under
# which pixelplanet is available, NOT ending with /

#OIDC_URL = https://example.com

# ================================= Socials ===================================#

# Contact email address for people to complain to

CONTACT_ADDRESS = admin@example.com

# Invite to your discord / guilded / matrix server which shows in the footer of
# windows
CHAT_INVITE = https://discord.gg/example

# =========================== Third Party Logins ==============================#

# platforms to get an id and key.
# You MUST set the ID, SECRET and R_URI to be able to use them.

# ========================= Backup / Historical View ==========================#

# Settings for the backup script that creates full canvas backups daily in the
# form of PNG tile files and incremential backups all BACKUP_INTERVAL minutes
# that saves PNG tiles with the differences since the last full daily backup.
# This is also used for the historical view.

# The backup script requires a second running redis instance, which it uses to
# compare to the current state.
# The BACKUP_REDIS_URL instance WILL GET WIPED once per day, so make sure
# that this is correct! It is NOT THE GAME REDIS.

BACKUP_REDIS_URL = redis://localhost:6380

# Directory where the backup tiles get saved

BACKUP_DIR = ./backup

# Interval in minutes on when to create incremental backups

BACKUP_INTERVAL = 20

# Command that gets executed after each backup completed. Useful for syncing
# scripts.

#BACKUP_CMD = /home/.../rsync.sh

# The url, where the backup files are available. If this is set, historical view
# will get enabled. It has to point to a URL that serves the BACKUP_DIR.
# You have to setup nginx to serve it and need "autoindex" to be on, because
# parsing the index is how pixelplanet finds the available times.
BACKUP_URL = http://localhost:5000/backup
